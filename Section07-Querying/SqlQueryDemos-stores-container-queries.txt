-- *** Projections ***

-- Get all documents (project all properties from all stores)
SELECT * FROM c

-- Project just the ID and store name properties
SELECT c.id, c.name
FROM c

-- Project just the store name property
SELECT c.name
FROM c

-- Project just the store name property as a string array using VALUE
SELECT VALUE c.name
FROM c

-- Use string concatenation for a single value
SELECT VALUE c.name || ', ' || c.address.countryRegionName

-- Project entirely different shape using inline JSON

-- *** ORDER BY ***

-- Sort ascending and descending on any property
-- Note that sorting on multiple properties is supported, but requires that you first

-- Get the first page (TOP) or any page (OFFSET...LIMIT) of a sorted resultset.

-- *** Subset filtering ***

-- Get all city and state names
SELECT
